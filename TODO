Short term

Need to stop enemy knockback through walls

Work on dungeon generation.
Add coin drops
Add dungeon counts: Silver (total dungeons completed) and Gold (unique dungeons completed).
    - Dungeon difficulty should scale off gold dungeons

Add knockbackmin, knockbackmax to weapons for variation
Add random speed variations to npcs in spawn
Make slime into npc class (generic like weapon)

Dungeons should spawn in the overworld
Add player swipe animation
Make underworld sprite dict?
Add npc tile collision

Make portal side collision work - why does it work from every side?




Make enemies not walk on each other
add knockback resistance to npcs

place_building_get_coords
    - Hover should hover the whole building size
    - Should be colour coded where you cant place

Make player-built structures be stored somewhere (so they can later be removed and replaced with grass if wished)


Create build/money logic
Add some free music to randomly play https://soundimage.org/fantasywonder/
Free coin sounds
    - https://soundimage.org/sfx-coins/

Long term
Work on void detection in underworld
Portal collisions are active on every corner. Fix this.
Don't allow building on player - semi working. Make less conservative.

Work out algorithm for optimising large maps (to avoid all sprites being created - only the screen should be created.)
Create a dungeon entrance that loads into the dungeon loop.
Make dungeons work
    - Should they be similar to the tile based world outside or more close up?
Create saves
Create inventory
    - Shows gold, shows land

Create npc to sell land

Create logic for npcs to spawn if enough spare land

Create far out natural structures that can be built to?
    - Special items, special dungeons, etc
    - Special companions?

Create times in overworld?
