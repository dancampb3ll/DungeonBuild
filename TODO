Short term

Make player movement better (so you don't need to be exactly on the tile alignment to be able to move.)

place_building_get_coords
    - Hover should hover the whole building size
    - Should be colour coded where you cant place

Make player-built structures be stored somewhere (so they can later be removed and replaced with grass if wished)


Create build/money logic
Add some free music to randomly play https://soundimage.org/fantasywonder/
Free coin sounds
    - https://soundimage.org/sfx-coins/

Long term
Portal collisions are active on every corner. Fix this.
Don't allow building on player - semi working. Make less conservative.

Work out algorithm for optimising large maps (to avoid all sprites being created - only the screen should be created.)
Create a dungeon entrance that loads into the dungeon loop.
Make dungeons work
    - Should they be similar to the tile based world outside or more close up?
Create saves
Create inventory
    - Shows gold, shows land

Create npc to sell land

Create logic for npcs to spawn if enough spare land

Create far out natural structures that can be built to?
    - Special items, special dungeons, etc
    - Special companions?

Create times in overworld?
