Short term
place_building_get_coords
    - Expand to get selected build type
    - Fix build hover logic (currently is movement only)
    - Hover should hover the whole building
    - Should be colour coded where you cant place
    - Don't allow building on player

Make build work for grass (will need to be new function)
    - Will work by checking if tile is made of border. If yes, replace with grass.
    - Will need to add function in gameloop which checks world and applies border to adjacent cells
        - NOPE - just get mouse location on screen + offset then divide by tile size ******************************************

Make build structures be stored somewhere (so they can later be removed and replaced with grass if wished)

Optimise some functions to stop passing in whole classes, only certain parameters to promote "loose coupling"


Create build/money logic
Get free 16x16 player sprites
Add some free music to randomly play https://soundimage.org/fantasywonder/
Free coin sounds
    - https://soundimage.org/sfx-coins/

Long term
Work out algorithm for optimising large maps (to avoid all sprites being created - only the screen should be created.)
Create a dungeon entrance that loads into the dungeon loop.
Make dungeons work
    - Should they be similar to the tile based world outside or more close up?
Create saves
Create inventory
    - Shows gold, shows land

Create npc to sell land

Create logic for npcs to spawn if enough spare land

Create far out natural structures that can be built to?
    - Special items, special dungeons, etc
    - Special companions?

Create times in overworld?
